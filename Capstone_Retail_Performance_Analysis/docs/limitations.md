# Limitations

This document outlines known limitations of the analysis
and areas that were intentionally excluded.

---

## 1. Dataset Scope

- The dataset represents a sample retail operation
- Results may not generalize to all retail businesses
- Customer-level behavior analysis is limited

The dataset is suitable for learning and demonstration,
not for real-world decision-making.

---

## 2. No Advanced Analytics

The project does not include:

- Forecasting or predictive modeling
- Customer segmentation
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Machine learning techniques

The focus remains on descriptive analysis and visualization.

---

## 3. Profit Interpretation

- Profit values are taken as-is from the dataset
- No cost breakdown is available
- Margin analysis is limited to aggregate comparison

This restricts deeper financial insights.

---

## 4. Dashboard Constraints

- Power BI visuals are limited to basic charts
- No custom visuals or advanced DAX measures are used
- Performance depends on dataset size and browser environment

The dashboard is optimized for clarity, not complexity.

---

## 5. Automation & Scalability

- The pipeline is script-based, not automated
- No scheduling or incremental refresh is implemented
- Manual execution is required for reprocessing data

This is acceptable given the project scope.

---

## Summary

These limitations are intentional and aligned with the goals
of the capstone project.

They highlight opportunities for future improvement while
keeping the current analysis focused and understandable.
